  SCP-5000 is to be kept in a deactivated state within a standard storage unit located at Site-22. All files and intelligence retrieved from SCP-5000 are to be stored on a secure server, with backups available upon request from the Archival Department.

   Description:
  </strong>
  SCP-5000 is a non-functional mechanical suit identified within its internal schematics as an 'Absolute Exclusion Harness' designed by the SCP Foundation. Although SCP-5000 is believed to have once possessed a number of anomalous functions intended to protect and benefit its occupant, damage inflicted to it in the past means that it is currently only capable of basic file storage. For a record of files contained within SCP-5000 upon recovery, see Archive 5000-1.

   My name is Pietro Wilson. I don't know what's happening. I think I might be the only one left.

   The date is um oh two oh one twenty twenty (sorry thought transcription is tricky (sorry im not used to this yet um)). The date is 02/01/2020. I've just. I have just escaped from Exclusionary Site-06. I think … I'm not certain, but I think everyone else is dead. Those guys, they were thorough. If I hadn't got to the suit, I'd be … oh god.

   I need to get myself together or this thing isn't going to be legible at all. Most likely they're going to want some kind of record of this whole incident for posterity.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm currently on my way to the nearest Foundation installation - a small safe-house for Agents making their way through this part of the country. Most likely there won't be anyone there, but I should be able to get into contact with my superiors and find out what exactly is going on.
  </p>
  <p>
   Things started around six, maybe seven hours ago. A group identifying themselves as Mobile Task Force Zeta-19 ("Lonely Only") - Insurgent infiltrators, maybe? - entered the Site, they had proper identification and everything, and gathered everyone into the canteen. Then they started the shooting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, I … I can still taste the blood. I can't get that awful metal taste off my tongue. It's a miracle I didn't get hit or trampled on, the way people were climbing over each other to get out of there. If I hadn't gotten to the Exclusion Harness, I'd be dead. No doubt about it - like I said, they were thorough.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm a technician for the power grid on ES-06, so I don't fully get how this thing works, but I understand the basics. This perception filter thing doesn't mean people can't see me, but it
   <em>
    does
   </em>
   mean they can't recognize the fact that they can see me. Which I guess is the same thing when you get down to it.
  </p>
  <p>
   But those infiltrators … they didn't even take anything, didn't even try to. I watched after I got into this thing - I was too scared (fucking coward) to make a run for it. They just checked the bodies and left. An extra bullet for every head.
  </p>
  <p>
   They were just there to kill us.

   Finally made it to the safe-house after hours and hours of trudging through this goddamn desert. Heard a few explosions in the distance - maybe the Foundation sent an MTF to engage those infiltrators before they got away? Hope so.
  </p>
  <p>
   Never been happier to see bottled water in my life. The Harness sustains your body while you're wearing it, apparently, but my mind still thinks I should be drinking. Human nature, I guess.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anyway, once I get these legs of mine rested, I'm going to try to get these systems online. I need to get in touch with the Foundation and find out what exactly is going on.

  Immediately following the release of their worldwide announcement, the Foundation began their assault on mankind.
 </p>
 <p>
  The response to the anomalies the Foundation let loose was as quick as it could have been, but the damage is being done. It's hard to tell what exactly is going on, but from my position here - accessing the Foundation network and keeping track of the news - I've managed to grasp a little. I'm going to get everything I know down - so that when this is over, if anyone's still alive, they'll know what happened to us.

   It's funny. With the supplies in this place - not to mention the Exclusion Harness - I could probably survive for years right here. But the idea of being sat here, with no idea what's going on in the outside world … it's unbearable. Still, I'm not sure whether I really want to know what's happening out there either.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I was a kid - real sick all the time, not able to go out that much - I was really into detective stories, Sherlock Holmes and all that shit. I always wanted to figure things out. Anyway, my dad had this row of plant-pots on the wall outside the house, and they were always getting knocked over, but he could never figure out what was doing it. That was pretty much at my peak of detective obsession, so I was on the case like nothing else. I was a stupid shit, so I couldn't actually
   <em>
    deduce
   </em>
   anything, you understand, so I ended up buying this cheap spy camera and recording the wall overnight.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was a stray cat. My dad ended up kicking it to death, like I should have known he would. Curiosity … well, you know the saying. Everyone involved would have been better off if I'd minded my own business. Except my dad, but fuck him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Damned if you do, damned if you don't, but I'd rather be doing something than nothing. Besides, if I have the Exclusion Harness, nothing that would want to hurt me will ever know I'm there.

   I'm a tourist at the end of the world. Destination: Site-19. Closest

   When I thought of Site-19 as being relatively close by, I never really took into account that was probably with a vehicle in mind. Can't risk cars or anything like that - even if I went unnoticed, the vehicle wouldn't. All it takes is one Foundation soldier or wandering anomaly to spot it and I'm as good as dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   But still, marching through the woods - even with the Harness' protection - isn't the most pleasant experience. It'd be hard to move out of the way if anything came traipsing through, for one. Just because things can't notice me doesn't mean they can't run me down.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gives me time to think, though. Like - why the hell am I even going to Site-19? What do I hope to accomplish? If I wanted to stay out of danger, survive as long as possible, I'd be best suited getting as far away from any Foundation personnel as possible, not jumping right into the viper's nest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Answers, I guess. More than anything, I want answers.

  Reached Site-19. Security's in disrepair, most of the anomalies let loose a while ago, so it was actually pretty easy to get in. Still stressful, moving out of the way of the researchers as they went about their business. They were still talking like colleagues, discussing how to get maximum human casualties like it was something they'd always been doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  But their eyes … it was like something was missing from them. Some spark. I couldn't see them as human, looking at their eyes. Maybe not even alive. Hard to describe, but it gave me the creeps.

  Not quite certain what all this means. Did the O5 Council send out some kind of memetic agent to get everyone to go along with them? But that wouldn't explain why the O5 Council would want to wipe out humanity in the first place. I don't get it. I just don't get it.

   It's been about three months since my last entry. God knows what I've been doing since then. The time between then and now is a complete blank in my memory, and it looks like the files from that period have been deleted as well. As far as I know, I should be the only one able to do that, so take that as you will.
  </p>
  <p>
   I seem like I've been through a few rough patches. I have a few scars that I don't quite recognize, and I have a bandage wrapped around my temple. The Exclusion Harness doesn't seem to be damaged, though, so I don't know what hurt me. Did I fall off a cliff or something? The sad part is I can actually see myself doing something like that. Never was the smartest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Site-19 is long-gone - well, it's still there, I assume, but I'm halfway across the country. Couldn't tell you why. It's weird, though. I feel like I have a purpose now, even though I'm not 100% sure what it is. Just where I need to go.
  </p>
  <p>
   There's a briefcase in my hand. I'm having trouble recalling what exactly is inside it - all I know is that
   <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-055">
    it isn't round
   </a>
   , and I need to get it to SCP-579.

   I underestimated how long it would take to get to SCP-579. Site-19 was a trek all on its own, but 579 is another story entirely. I wouldn't even know where it was without this documentation - which I have no idea how I obtained, but that's besides the point.

   I've stopped counting the corpses I've walked past. It's probably in the quadruple digits now. Jesus, maybe higher.

   Came across the dead body of a kid, a little boy, in a house I was grabbing some supplies from a while back. At first, I thought he'd just been shot in the head, but when I went to bury him I could see there were things moving underneath his skin. Little pale worms, hundreds of them, that poured out the second I touched them. They all had his face. They were all laughing. Scurried off into the drain.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't try to bury people anymore. Keeping going is a lot more difficult than you'd think.

  This thing in the briefcase is a godsend. Don't know what the hell it is, but if things are getting too much for me, I just need to open it up - and the next thing I know, I'm miles further along from where I just was, feeling all warm inside like something gave me a pep-talk. It's like my own personal skip button for when things are getting rough.

   It's nice having company, even if they don't know you're there. I'm sat around a fire with a group of GOC soldiers who are trying to make their way … well, I don't think they actually have anywhere to go at this point. Just wandering, maybe. I thought about revealing myself, trying to ask them help me get to 579, but I don't want to risk it. Maybe I've just gotten used to not existing.

  Interview log from an interrogation facility inside Ganzir. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time a captured member of Foundation personnel has spoken during interrogation. Interviewer is a Commander Morrison, with a scientist called Doctor Rhodes also being there. The guy being interrogated is a member of Mobile Task Force Omega-2 ("Secret Keepers"), Samuel Ross. No video, only audio. Don't know if that's something wrong with the file or just the way it was recorded in the first place.

   It's getting hard to keep going. When the GOC were keeping up the fight, there was this sense that things could still be turned around, but with them on the run now too it's easy to feel there's no point to all this. With Ganzir taken care of, the Foundation has turned their full attention back to everyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't eat or drink anymore. The Harness takes care of all that, anyway, and there's too much of a risk that anything I consume will be contaminated by one of the awful viruses the Foundation is trying to spread. I've seen corpses in pretty much every state imaginable by this point. Some of them walking around, even.
  </p>

   Every time I open the briefcase, to skip, I make a little less progress, feel a little worse. Whatever was helping me before, it's like I've grown numb to it. Wouldn't be the only thing.

  <p>
   Have been making my way towards 579 - maybe a little slower than before, but who can blame me for lack of motivation? Been seeing some strange things lately. Stranger than usual, I mean.
  </p>
  <p>
   First are the Blinkers. There's been quite a few of those around lately. Now, I'm pretty sure these were created by the Foundation, even if I don't know how. I don't know most things, so just add this to the list.
  </p>
  <p>
   They're statues, statues of soldiers - MTF uniforms - with empty sockets for eyes. Their arms are carved into blades, like what you'd see on a praying mantis or something. They're harmless as long as you look at them. But the second you look away, they can move - and they're
   <em>
    fast
   </em>
   . Saw one cut through an entire crowd of people when a gust of smoke blocked it from view for just a second.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm wary of them. Me looking at them stops them too - so even if they don't perceive where I
   <em>
    am
   </em>
   , they're going to deduce that I'm there. Might just start slicing everything in sight, and then that's the end of me. Need to do my best to avoid them completely.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second thing I saw is … well, it's a lot weirder.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was on the horizon, like a person stretched out - no, that's not the best way to describe it. It was like the space
   <em>
    around
   </em>
   them was stretched out, and they were being stretched along with it, like some kind of bad photo-shop effect. Their body went from the ground up to the clouds, and their jaw swung at right angles. There were these
   <em>
    gaps
   </em>
   , as well, black gaps in space around its body, like wings. It just floated forwards like that.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were Foundation guys there, too, but they were
   <em>
    fighting
   </em>
   it, shooting it with guns and rockets. How fucked up is it that I'm thinking the Foundation fighting an anomaly is weird? Maybe they were like me, managed to get out when this all kicked off. Thought about talking to them, but decided not to. Can't risk it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Got out of there. I need to get to 579. I need to do
   <em>
    something
   </em>
   . Anything.

    is hanging around her neck.)

   I … I recognized you. The necklace, I mean.

   Ah, shit. They send you to kill me? You're gonna be here a while.
  </p>

   <strong>
    Pietro:

   No, I … I'm … I got away too. Did you get away too?

   <em>

   . You look like shit, pal. When was the last time you slept?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   The suit … um, you don't need to sleep with it on.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   You
   <em>
    do
   </em>
   need to sleep. Your face, it's just … it's seriously a disaster, man. You hate to see it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause.)

  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:

   Can I come in?

   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   But of course. There's enough broken glass for everyone!
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   I was joking, you know. You could have grabbed a chair.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   It's fine. The suit's sturdy.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>

   <strong>
    Girl:

   That's a fancy piece of kit you've got there.
   <em>
    (gestures to necklace)
   </em>
   Wanna trade?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (laughs, coughs)
   </em>
   No way! I've read the file.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Worth a shot. Been a while since you laughed, huh?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:

   Not been much to laugh
   <em>
    at

  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (chuckles)
   </em>
   Okay, that
   <em>
    was
   </em>
   kind of funny.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause.)
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   So, you got away too. I mean, I'm assuming you were a Foundation guy, not one of the many people I've pissed off in my lifetime here for revenge.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   Aren't those the same thing?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (laughs)
   </em>
   Now you're getting it!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   Yeah, I'm Foundation.
   <em>
    Was
   </em>
   Foundation, I mean. Got lucky when this all started, got into the suit and escaped. You?
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause.)
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Well, I was Senior Staff - we would have been told about the plan before anyone else, but damn if I can't remember what it was. Probably because of the
   <em>
    second
   </em>
   file.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   The second file? You saw it?
   <em>
    (stands)
   </em>
   What was it?!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Woah, cool your jets, kid. We've got all the time in the world. They were just a bunch of images - eggs, trees, religious stuff. Didn't mean anything to me by themselves, but I guess they had something encoded in them. Didn't take like they should have -
   <em>
    (taps necklace)
   </em>
   - probably because of this thing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (sits down)
   </em>
   So it
   <em>
    was
   </em>
   a memetic agent…
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (frowns)
   </em>
   Don't know about that. I've pretty much had everything that can happen to me, well,
   <em>
    happen to me
   </em>
   . I know what a memetic agent feels like. It didn't feel like that - more like I was being released from something than something being forced on me.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   I … I see. So, you don't really know what's going on, either?
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause.)
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Nope.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   Fuck …
   <em>
    fuck
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause. The girl removes a small bottle of beer from her pocket and takes a swig.)
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (sighs)
   </em>
   So, you heading somewhere or just wandering around feeling sorry for yourself?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   I'm heading to 579.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (laughs)
   </em>
   If you're suicidal, there are easier ways to go about it, believe me!
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   You know what it is?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Not a clue - which is concerning, because I'm kind of a big deal.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    (Pause.)
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   Doesn't matter. I have to get there.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   Why?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   I just do. Where are you headed?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1437">
    1437
   </a>
   . Gonna see if I can't piss into another universe. Then throw this amulet down there and see where I wake up.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (chuckles)
   </em>
   Sounds like a plan. Good luck to you.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Girl:
   </strong>
   <em>
    (stands up)
   </em>
   I'd wish you good luck, too, but we both know you're not getting it. Day's about to break - I'm heading off.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Pietro:
   </strong>
   Okay.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>

   <strong>
    Girl:

   I hope you find what you're looking for, at least.

  <p>
   Hi, journal. It's been a while.
  </p>
  <p>
   Right now, I'm looking at Site-62C, where SCP-579 is supposed to be. There are no guards, as far as I can see, and all the security is down. It looks like the place has been abandoned for a while. I was under the impression that this place was extremely high priority, but it looks like the Foundation doesn't agree with me anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have the briefcase in my hands. It's difficult to breathe. I feel like everything will end soon, one way or another.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm heading in.

   Hi again, journal. I know I ended the last entry so dramatically, and it's been about thirty seconds since then, but I have an important update.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second I got close to Site-62C, I got a feeling like someone was pressing a gun against the back of my head. Like I was standing on the edge of a roof, and someone's hands were on my back, ready to push me. Some fight or flight shit, dialed up as far as it would go.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't know what SCP-579 is. But I know it's looking at me.

  <p>
   That's not fair.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I
   <em>
    made it
   </em>
   . That's not fair. They're stuck behind the door - I can hear them slashing at it, but it's reinforced, will hold for a little while. A couple of minutes, at least.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm in an observation chamber, full of instruments for monitoring SCP-579. The actual containment chamber is right below me. I can just barely see it, if I strain my eyes a little. There's a hole. There's a hole in the floor that leads right down there.
  </p>
  <p>
   I know where 579 is. Even if the instruments weren't here, I can
   <em>
    feel
   </em>
   it. You can't be near it
   <em>
    without
   </em>
   feeling it, probably. For a second, I thought I could just drop the briefcase into the hole and be done with it, but that would be too easy, wouldn't it? After walking halfway across the world, I guess I haven't earned the right for something to be easy.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the angle of the hole, and where 579 is, the briefcase wouldn't even come close to touching it. The only way it's making contact is if I were to jump in the hole and throw it on my way down. But that height … throwing the briefcase would be the last thing I'd do.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course. Of fucking course.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's taken me my whole life to realize, but I'm not the kind of person that can be a detective. I'm just the murder victim. I die for someone else's story. And the human race is going with me. I know whodunnit, howdunnit … but those were obvious. Everyone knows those, those were handed to me. I don't know
   <em>
    why
   </em>
   . In the end, I couldn't figure out even a single thing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Why is this happening? Why is the Foundation killing everybody? Why is this happening? Why did they send out those files? Why is this happening? Why did Ganzir fall? Why is this happening? Why am I taking this briefcase across the world?
   <em>
    Why is this happening?!
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Why am I here? Why am I doing this? Why am I … why am I going to die? Is there a reason?
  </p>
  <p>
   If anyone is ever reading this, please, please, figure it out. Explain it to me. Someone …
   <em>
    anyone
   </em>
   . I don't get it. I don't get it…
  </p>
  <p>
   They're about to get in. First foot forward.
